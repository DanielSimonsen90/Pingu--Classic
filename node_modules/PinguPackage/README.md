# HOW TO UPDATE MODULE

The "PinguPackage" module, comes from the ./live/index.d.ts folder. ./live is generated when running ./src/index.ts -- **Make sure you open the PinguPackage folder in an editor, and not just the index.ts file solely!**
Anything modified in ./live should be overwritten, as each time there's a change to PinguPackage, ./live should be deleted.
Once deleted, run the ./src/index.ts file. This should generate a new ./live with the modified changes.

If something happens to cause errors in the new live version, make sure you **update the ./src version** to fix them!

If there is an extra file that should be added (i.e. a JSON file), add the file to tsconfig.json - the format is from root of PinguPackage and then which file from there needs to be saved.
